      <p>
        This application is built to demonstrate handwritten document retrieval systems for collections written in different Indic scripts. Handwritten documents written by a specific person or handwritten documents containing information related to a specific domain that may hold a historical significance are referred to as <b><i>Collections</i></b> in this project.
        <br>
        To the best of our knowledge, this application is the first attempt to build a retreival system for handwritten documents written in Indian languages.
